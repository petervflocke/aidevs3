Instructions
Interpret the maze as a grid where each row is listed from top to bottom and each column from left to right.
Start at the position labeled S and find a path to reach G without moving through # cells.
You can move in one of four directions:
UP: decrease row by 1.
DOWN: increase row by 1.
RIGHT: increase column by 1.
LEFT: decrease column by 1.
If right is available, use it, but do not deviate more than one row or column from the current row.
If a previous cell moves toward the goal more directly, prioritize that path even if it isn’t immediately reachable.”

Output the sequence of moves needed to reach the goal, using the directions up, down, left, or right. Output final solution like this: <RESULT> { "steps": "UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT" } </RESULT>
